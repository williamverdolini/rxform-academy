                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Reactive forms provide a robust and scalable way to manage complex forms in Angular applications.
                  Here are some pros and cons compared to template-driven forms:</p>
                <h4>Pros:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Reactive forms are more suitable for complex forms with dynamic
                    controls and validations.</li>
                  <li><strong>Testability:</strong> They are easier to unit test due to their synchronous nature and
                    explicit structure.</li>
                  <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Reactive forms offer better type safety, especially with the use of
                    nonNullable types.</li>
                  <li><strong>Performance:</strong> They generally perform better with large forms as they reduce change
                    detection cycles.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>(human made ðŸ˜…):</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Low complexity:</strong> Once you get familiar with it, things are easy and quick to
                    implement, and it often works on the first try.</li>
                  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Forces you to think in terms of form design, separating validation logic
                    from store logic or component logic, for example.</li>
                  <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> With a modular architecture in mind, dynamically created forms
                    with the ability to add runtime validations is the way to go.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Cons:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><s><strong>Complexity:</strong> Reactive forms can be more complex and verbose to set up compared
                      to template-driven forms.</s></li>
                  <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> When it comes to managing composition or reuse of components with
                    dynamic behaviors, things get complicated because you don't have control over everything as you do
                    with <code>template-driven forms</code>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> They have a steeper learning curve, especially for developers new
                    to Angular.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>(human made):</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Watch out for reactivity:</strong> validations and form data logic need to be handled
                    carefully to avoid creating infinite loops.</li>
                  <li><strong>Validation 2.0:</strong> error handling and validation methods (warnings) could be
                    improved, and the current handling forces external or different management of warnings.</li>
                </ul>
